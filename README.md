#### Why
Do you need a massive performance overhead, complexity and tangled flow control to build a high-end, enterprise-level or pet-project websites? Wavefront is light, ultra-fast and declarative but most importantly Wavefront has [**no vendor lock-In** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in).
___
### Separation of Concerns
**Wavefront in essence is a view-layer library, design pattern and a discipline based on ES6 and first-class functions**. It uses the concept of **_Declarative Templates_** to separate logic from presentation. Build application logic however you prefer providing there is no explicit logic within your templates. 
___
### Ultra-fast
**Wavefront was designed to build real world websites and web applications not theoretical benchmarks challenges**. However it is possiblyone of the fastest "virtual-DOM" implementations out there.
___
### A Comprehensive DOM Solution
- _Abstract from the DOM_
- _Render to the DOM_
- _Expose the cached DOM_
- _DOM helper functions_
- _Statically generate HTML per build (As a SSR Alternative)_
___
### No Vendor Lock-In
Migration and vendor lock-in are expensive aspects of front-end development. wavefront-migration converts _Declarative Templates_ into HTML not only to escape lock-in but in case you have built Wavefront SPA interfaces you would like to later migrate to HTML.  
___

Wavefront is currently 1kb minified but will not exceed 3kb
___
